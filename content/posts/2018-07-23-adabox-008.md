AdaBox <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adabox008/unboxing-adabox-008" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#008</a>Â arrived this week, and the theme this time was&#8230;robots!

I loved building robots in college, so was excited to dive into this box.

The project I chose to start with was a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/crickit-carnival-bumper-car-bot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-driving robotic car</a> that can detect when it&#8217;s bumped into things via an accelerometer in the circuit board, reverse, and change direction. Basically a roomba except it won&#8217;t vacuum the floor for you.

It does provide great entertainment for cats, though!

(Also pictured &#8211; the rainbow slinky that came as a freebie for subscribers!)

One interesting thing about this project is that the code was actually written through <a href="https://makecode.adafruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MakeCode</a>, which is one of those GUI-based code editors except streamlined for hardware programming. As a software engineer I would rather just write code, but this looks like a great tool for kids and people new to programming who don&#8217;t want to mess around with the intricacies of code.

The other cool thing is that the robot frame is built using cardboard. A big theme for all the projects in this box is incorporating cheap materials like cardboard and popsicle sticks, so you can make robotics projects without spending a lot of money. It&#8217;s a hybrid of crafts and robotics and I love the approach. The downside, of course, is that the quality isn&#8217;t as good; the double-sided foam tape that came with the box didn&#8217;t work well and one of the robot&#8217;s wheels kept falling off. But overall this box felt fun and creative &#8211; more robotics kits should come with bags of googly eyes!
