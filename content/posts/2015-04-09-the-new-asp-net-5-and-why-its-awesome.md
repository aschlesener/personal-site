title: The new ASP.NET 5 and why it's awesome

So Microsoft is coming out with a new version of the ASP.NET framework, and I am excited! Here&#8217;s why:

  1. **It&#8217;s open-source. **That&#8217;s awesome, and a pretty radical shift for Microsoft.
  2. **Web Forms are going away.** Need I say more?
  3. **It&#8217;s cross-platform. **Meaning it can now run on Linux, yay! (Mac too, for you Apple fans.)
  4. **It&#8217;s lightweight and modular. **No word yet on just how much more so, but it looks promising.
  5. **It&#8217;s got more support for front-end stuff. **Grunt, Gulp, Bower, NPM&#8230; it&#8217;s all supported.
  6. **Dependency injection! **This is now baked straight in to ASP.NET; you don&#8217;t have to use third-party frameworks. This is probably the change I&#8217;m looking forward to the most.

For you other .NET nerds, do you plan on giving the beta version a try?

**Edit**: As of January 2016 (really November 2015, but I&#8217;m late to updating), ASP.NET 5 Release Candidate (RC) 1 is out! We&#8217;ve been using this on a project at my work, and it is fantastic. Still a few things to iron out (for example, we encountered a few snafus in <a href="http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/publishing/iis.html" target="_blank">publishing to IIS</a>) but overall I am really happy with the new features and overall direction the framework has gone in.

Here&#8217;s a link to the current documentation: <a href="http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/conceptual-overview/aspnet.html" target="_blank">http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/conceptual-overview/aspnet.html</a>
