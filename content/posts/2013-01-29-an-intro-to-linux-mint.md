First released in 2006, <a title="Linux Mint" href="http://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a> is a &#8220;flavor&#8221; of the Unix-like operating system <a title="Linux" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank">Linux</a> that has gained widespread popularity and continues to be one of the easiest versions of Linux for beginners to use.

Mint is based on another popular and widely-used Linux flavor, <a title="Ubuntu" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>, but differs in that it comes with pre-installed software and plugins so that it is functional directly out-of-the-box. This feature is extremely appealing to new users of Linux who don&#8217;t want to experience the hassle of figuring out how to download and install this software themselves on an unfamiliar new environment.

Some of the most useful pre-installed software: <a title="GIMP" href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a>, a free alternative to Photoshop; <a title="http://www.libreoffice.org/" href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a>, a free alternative to MS Office; <a title="Banshee" href="http://banshee.fm/" target="_blank">Banshee</a>, a media player similar to iTunes that you can sync with your Android, iPod, or what have you; essentially everything that someone used to the Windows/Mac GUIs might be looking for.

On a personal note, while I now prefer Ubuntu for my daily work, Mint was definitely the right choice when I was starting out, mostly due to the clean and simple Windows-like look. Plus, the gray and green color scheme is gorgeous!<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 545px">

If you&#8217;re really interested in the technical differences between Linux distributions, <a href="http://distrowatch.com" target="_blank">distrowatch.com</a> is a great resource (thanks to my old dentist, who recommended it during a discussion on our favorite distros!). Here is their article on <a href="http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=mint" target="_blank">Mint</a>.
