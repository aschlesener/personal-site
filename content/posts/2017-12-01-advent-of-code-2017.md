As I announced on Twitter&#8230;

{{< tweet 936765159388995584>}}

I&#8217;m doing the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) this year! It&#8217;s like an advent calendar, except you have to solve programming problems instead of getting chocolate. (Okay, so maybe a chocolate advent calendar in addition to the advent of code is in order).

Since I haven&#8217;t had the opportunity to do much in Go at work lately (mostly been wrangling ElasticSearch and Java), solving these problems in Go should be a good way to keep my Golang skills sharp. Or it&#8217;ll just be really annoying. We&#8217;ll see!

If you want to follow along, I&#8217;ll be posting my solutions each day on my [Github](https://github.com/aschlesener/advent-of-code-2017).
